# Colophon
I build this website mostly for recording the more technical aspect of projects that is hard to show in a reel

Also for storing my notes and process when I work on project
This site is built with Astro and styled with Tailwindcss.

## Software
- Astro
- Tailwindcss 
- VSCode
- Frontmatter CMS

## Design
### Look and feel
Minimalist, only necessary info on the page, breathing room
### icon

## TODO:

      2. helpful tutorials
      3. Houdini nodes and vex usages
      4. python in Houdin
