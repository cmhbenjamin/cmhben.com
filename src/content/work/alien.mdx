## Zero gravity spinning acid
In the sequence the gravity was disabled so when the alien got shot the acid fly around freely.
Initially it was flying freely but the art direction later changed it slowly form a spinning tube like tunnel, so the characters can navigate through it in the middle.
The Fx lead generated a number of different acid shape and we placed them along the scene.

- placing the acid cache is more efficient for hero pieces since there are too much art direction involed
- need a way to store the scattered points so when the upperstream setup change we keep the look for the pieces
- using instanced acide geo helps to keep the look of the acid consistence, but lack interaction
- using post deform with a velocity field help adding variation to the acid pieces

### Acid shapes look

- Directional, like a hand reaching out
- Fluid like motion, with surface tension stringy look
- slow, looking dangerous, drifting through the space





### Notes
- hand placing of hero acid is better than using scatter and randomly placing
- having a setup to swap out low res version of the acid speed up, Level of detail for efficiency, use low res acid for figure out layout and motion
- store randomized result for pickup later when using scatter always save the point attributes so you can have a version of the distribution even when  you change the upperstream
- Building attractive looking for nice looking acid shapes
- keep the setup simple


#### Houdini setup

##### Source
![splash source cluster](/alien/splash_source_v001.png)
1. use mountain and transform then subtract with the orignal position for v
![dopnet](/alien/splash_source_v002.png)
2. group by cluster to create structure and randomize v by cluster to create the stringy look, set some of the v to 0 to get the stringy look. An alternative way is to use rbd fracture the source geo as source.

##### Simulation
most important part is the scale and surface tension setting. The overall scene scale depends on the smallest detail you want to see . So it often need to be larger than real world scale. 
I use a top wedging setup to find the right look of the liquid
1. Higher substeps
2. Add id attribute
##### Wedging setup
![topnet](/alien/splash_topnet_v001.png)
1. Wedging attributes
    ![topnet](/alien/splash_topnet_v002.png)
    Wedging the velocity noise size and surface tension to find the right look
![wedge](/alien/splash_wedge_v001.png)
2. OpenImageIO for adding details into the picture

3. Use ImageMagick to combine image for montage

###### quick attempt to reducing holes
3. surface oversampling helps with keeping the elongated shape continue but adding particles in the missing area
4. particle separation helps with keeping the points in the thin film evenly distributed so there will be less holes poping 
5. reducing the grid scale (increasing resolution) helps so there will be enough resolution for thin area

Recreation at home

### Acid advection
Acid where retimed and advected by a vdb field to create more directable motion

### Secondary elements
Some seconary effects includes broken alien pieces, smaller acid droplets for smaller details and cached static smoke and simulated smoke emit when acid touch the wall
- Alien pieces
- Acid droplets
- Acid smokes at melting metal
