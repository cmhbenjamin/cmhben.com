## Zero gravity spinning acid
In the sequence the gravity was disabled so when the alien got shot the acid fly around freely.
Initially it was flying freely but the art direction later changed it slowly form a spinning tube like tunnel, so the characters can navigate through it in the middle.
The Fx lead generated a number of different acide shape and we placed them along the scene.
