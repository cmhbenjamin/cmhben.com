# Houdini minimalist

# Pyro
## Creating source
polygon to volume with vdb
- more simple but noise is harder to control compare to particles
point to volume
- better control with attributes on points
- rasterize after
### Volumerasteriseattributes
#### Coverage
Name of the point attribute that stores the coverage (or influence) of each particle. If the coverage attribute does not exist, 
each particle is assumed to have a coverage of 1.
#### Attribute Rules
Different ways to interpolate particles values into voxel, control per attributes
