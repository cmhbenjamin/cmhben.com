# How to use Copernicus the wrong way
> **`WIP post`**
- I was trying to use **Copernicus** as a Nuke replacement, 
- there isn't a redirection of what replace what 


> TODO:
> - pictures of node, examples
## Common nodes nuke equivalent
| Copernicus |  Nuke|
|--------|----|
| File | Read|
| over | blend|
| noise | fractalnoise|
| remap | fit+ramp|
| bright | grade gain|
| hsv | satuation, value, hue|
| transform | transform|
| channel swap/add/split/extract | shuffle|
| glow | glow|

### Interesting nodes
- dilateerode = dilate
- chromaticaberration
