# Automating my demo reel 
I started using nixos on my server, it's a procedural os so every settings of the computer is defined in the configuration file. For my reel, why can't it do the same?

## Combining
## Adding text
## Front and end

## Issue encounter
Compositing a compositVideoClip on a video cause the edge to be pixalated. It looks like it's an alpha issue. To get around this, I just export the text as individual object,
instead of a compositVideoClip. 
[Probably related bug](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/issues/1472)

```python
combine_clip_text =CompositeVideoClip([title_clip,studio_clip,description_clip],size=(1920*2,1080*2))
combine_clip =CompositeVideoClip(video,combine_clip_text)
```
